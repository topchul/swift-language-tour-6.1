# Swift Language Tour 6.1 â€“ Playgrounds

This project is a collection of Swift Playgrounds based on the official book  
**[The Swift Programming Language (Swift 6.1)](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/)** published by Apple.

It serves as an interactive way to **explore**, **experiment with**, and **understand** Swift syntax and core language features through hands-on examples.
